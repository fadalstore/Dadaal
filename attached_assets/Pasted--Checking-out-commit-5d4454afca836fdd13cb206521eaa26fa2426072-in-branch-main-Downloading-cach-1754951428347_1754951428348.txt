INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of flask to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 1), Werkzeug==2.3.7 and werkzeug because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested Werkzeug==2.3.7
    The user requested werkzeug
    The user requested werkzeug
    flask 3.0.0 depends on Werkzeug>=3.0.0
To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.1.1 -> 25.2
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
